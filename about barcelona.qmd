Our city is plenty of markets where you can eat, drink or simply walk between the smells and colours of our lively city. The most tourist of them is the Boqueria (placed in Las Ramblas), but my personal recommendation here is the Sant Antoni Market. Placed in a modernist building dated from 1882 this market is the heart of the neighborhood of the same name. Do not forget to lost yourself around the surrounding streets and enjoy some of the most popular pubs and restaurants in Barcelona.
